# musix-mvvm

This is my personal project called Musix App. I created this project to learn more about the mvvm architectural pattern, also with firebase features. You can play, pause, skip or click the previous song.
It can also show details of a song when you click on it, play music in a background service, and have notifications that you can play it through that too. All songs are provided and saved from firebase.

Build with :
- MVVM 
- Coroutine
- Firebase Firestore
- Firebase Storage
- Exoplayer
- Gif Drawable
- Navigation
