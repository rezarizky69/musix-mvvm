# musix-mvvm

This is my personal project called Musix App. I create this project for learn deeper about mvvm architectural pattern, also with firebase feature. You can play, pause, skip or click on previous song.
It also can display the detail of the song when you click on it, play the music in background service, and has a notification that you can play from that too. All the songs stored from firebase.

Build with :
- MVVM 
- Coroutine
- Firebase Firestore
- Firebase Storage
- Exoplayer
- Gif Drawable
- Navigation
